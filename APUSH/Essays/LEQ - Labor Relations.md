During the 17th and 18th century, America saw an era of rapid technological development known as the Industrial Revolution. The result of new technologies would usher in the Gilded Age, which saw the rise of large businesses into monopolies. The period 1870 to 1900 experienced conflict over labor relations due to national labor unions and a laissez-faire government.

Workers during this age would often be subject to high hours and low wages, and would protest in a variety of ways, one of which was forming labor unions. These labor unions would often spread across the whole nation, one example of which was the National Labor Union. However, many of these protests would end violently, such as the Haymarket Square Riot which ended in the death of many. These unions and protests would create a state of tensions between owners and workers.

During the Gilded Age, the U.S. was a laissez-faire, or a hands-off government. Because of this approach to business affairs, large companies were able to gain and stay in almost absolute dominance of their respective industries. This can be seen in the Sherman Act, which while passed, was never regulated. The dominance of large companies while workers were plunged further into poverty would cause labor unions, strikes, and protests, causing conflict between workers and their employers.

The formation of labor unions and a lazy government would lead to mixed reactions from big companies. Some would create justifications through and economic form of Social Darwinism, claiming that strong companies had the right to eat the weaker businesses. Others would give back to the community through the principle of the Gospel of Wealth, which was the belief had a God-given duty to contribute to society.

In conclusion, relations between workers and owners experienced conflict due to the creation of labor unions and a lax government.
