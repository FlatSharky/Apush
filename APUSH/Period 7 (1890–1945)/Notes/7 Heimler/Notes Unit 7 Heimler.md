------------------------------------------------------------------
The New Deal marked a transition from a laissez-faire government to providing relief, reform, and recovery to the U.S. economy. Policies such as the Public Works Administration provided immediate relief for those unemployed. Other policies such as the Social Security Act were successful enough that they are still being employed today. All in all, the New Deal transformed the U.S. into a limited welfare state contrasting its previous laissez-faire policies.
