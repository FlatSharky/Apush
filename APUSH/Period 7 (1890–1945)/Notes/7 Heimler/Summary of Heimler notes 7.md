### American Imperialist Expansion

**Summary:** American imperialist expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries involved extending the nation's political, economic, and military influence globally. Key events included the purchase of Alaska in 1867 and the acquisition of territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines following the Spanish-American War. The expansion was driven by motives such as economic gains, strategic military positioning, and a belief in the racial and cultural superiority of Americans.

**Similarities and Differences in Attitudes:**

**Imperialists:**

- Believed in expanding American influence for economic benefits, such as access to new markets and resources (e.g., gold in Alaska).
- Supported by Social Darwinism, which justified expansion as a natural and beneficial process.
- Racial motives were prominent, with figures like Josiah Strong advocating that white Americans had a duty to spread their civilization and Christianity.
- Alfred Thayer Mahan emphasized naval power as crucial for global dominance, leading to the strengthening of the U.S. Navy and territorial acquisitions in the Pacific and Caribbean.

**Anti-Imperialists:**

- Advocated for self-determination, arguing that nations should have the right to choose their own rulers without external interference.
- Emphasized America's history of isolationism, warning against entanglements in foreign conflicts and the consequences of overreach.
- Raised racial concerns, questioning whether the U.S. Constitution and its protections would extend to new territories and their non-white inhabitants.
- Feared that imperialism contradicted American values of freedom and democracy.

### Spanish-American War

**Summary:** The Spanish-American War (1898) was fueled by economic interests, nationalist sentiments, and sensationalist journalism. The U.S. intervened in Cuba's struggle for independence from Spain, leading to a brief conflict that ended with American victory. The war resulted in Cuban independence (with U.S. oversight via the Platt Amendment) and the annexation of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

**Key Points:**

- Yellow journalism by publishers like Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst inflamed public opinion and pushed the U.S. towards war.
- The accidental explosion of the USS Maine was used as a pretext for war.
- Post-war, the U.S. faced resistance in the Philippines, leading to the Philippine-American War.
- The Open Door Policy aimed to maintain American trade interests in China amidst European spheres of influence.
