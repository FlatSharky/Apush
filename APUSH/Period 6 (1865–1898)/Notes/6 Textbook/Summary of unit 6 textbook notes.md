### Rise of Industrial America

#### Economic Growth

- By 1900, the U.S. became the leading industrial power.
- The economy grew rapidly due to:
    - Abundant natural resources (coal, iron ore, copper, lead, timber, oil).
    - An ample labor supply from immigrants.
    - Expanding population and transportation networks.
    - Plentiful capital from wealthy European investors.
    - Labor-saving technologies.
    - Government policies favorable to businesses.
    - Innovative entrepreneurs.

#### Business of Railroads

- **Significance**: Railroads were the nation's first big business and had the greatest impact on American economic life.
- **Effects**:
    - Created national markets for goods.
    - Promoted the growth of industries like coal and steel.
    - Standardized time (railroad time).
    - Developed modern stockholder corporations and complex financial structures.

#### Eastern Trunk Lines

- Inefficient separate rail lines were consolidated into trunk lines, such as the New York Central Railroad, Baltimore & Ohio, and Pennsylvania Railroad.

#### Western Railroads

- Railroads facilitated westward settlement, especially in the trans-Mississippi West, and linked the West with the East.

#### Federal Land Grants

- The federal government provided land grants and loans to 80 railroad companies, amounting to 170 million acres.
- **Consequences**:
    - Promoted rapid and often substandard construction.
    - Led to widespread corruption in government.

#### Transcontinental Railroads

- Congress authorized the first transcontinental railroad during the Civil War, built by the Union Pacific and Central Pacific companies.
- Employed many Chinese immigrants who faced significant risks.
- The two railroads met at Promontory Point, Utah.
- By 1900, four additional transcontinental railroads were completed.

#### Competition and Consolidation

- Many railroads were overbuilt and unprofitable in the 1870s and 1880s, leading to financial issues and fraud.
- Railroads used rebates and kickbacks, and tried to form pools.
- The financial panic of 1893 led to the bankruptcy of a quarter of the railroads.
- Bankers consolidated bankrupt railroads, resulting in seven giant systems controlling nearly two-thirds of the nation's railroads by 1900.
- **Outcome**: A more efficient but monopolistic railroad system controlled by a few powerful men.

#### Industrial Empires

- The late 19th century saw a major shift towards heavy industry, including steel, petroleum, and electric power production.

#### Steel Industry

- Innovations in steel production led to the rise of industrial giants.

#### Andrew Carnegie

- A poor Scottish immigrant who became a business magnate through vertical integration, controlling every stage of the steel production process.

#### U.S. Steel Corporation

- Carnegie sold his company for over $400 million in 1900, leading to the creation of the United States Steel Corporation, the world's first billion-dollar company.

#### Oil Industry

- The first U.S. oil drill was in Pennsylvania in 1859.
- John D. Rockefeller used horizontal integration to create a monopoly in the oil industry, organizing trusts to consolidate competitors.

#### Antitrust Movement

- Growing public concern about the power of trusts led to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, aiming to prohibit trusts that restrained trade or commerce.
- However, it was too vague to be effective, and the Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. E.C. Knight Co. limited its application to commerce, not manufacturing.

#### Laissez-Faire Capitalism

- The dominant economic belief of the late 19th century, advocating minimal government interference in business.
- Industrialists used this theory to justify their practices and resist regulation.

#### Social Darwinism

- Applied the concept of "survival of the fittest" to the business world, justifying the success of the wealthy and powerful.

#### Gospel of Wealth

- Many industrialists embraced the idea that they had a divine duty to use their wealth for the public good.
- Andrew Carnegie was a prominent advocate, donating over $350 million to public institutions and philanthropy.

This summary highlights the key factors and impacts of the rise of industrial America, focusing on the economic transformation, technological advancements, and the significant social and political changes of the era.
