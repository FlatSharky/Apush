**Formation of Colonies**

- **Thirteen Colonies:** Established along the Atlantic Coast between 1607 (Jamestown) and 1733 (Georgia).

**Types of Colonies**

- **Corporate Colonies:** Operated by joint stock companies (e.g., Jamestown).
- **Royal Colonies:** Under direct control of the King's government (e.g., Virginia).
- **Proprietary Colonies:** Controlled by individuals granted ownership by the king (e.g., Maryland, Pennsylvania).

**Chesapeake Colonies**

- **Subdivision and Proprietary Control:** King Charles subdivided Virginia, granting control to Lord Baltimore, creating Maryland.
- **Act of Toleration:** Passed in Maryland, granting religious freedom to Christians but imposed death for denying Jesus.

**Economic Problems in the 1660s**

- **Tobacco Overproduction:** Led to economic hardship in Maryland and Virginia.
- **House of Burgesses' Intervention:** Attempted to raise tobacco prices; London merchants responded by increasing prices of goods exported to Virginia.

**Headright System**

- **Land Incentives:** Offered 50 acres to immigrants or plantation owners who paid for an immigrant's passage.

**Bacon's Rebellion**

- **Labor Issues and Rebellion:** Nathaniel Bacon led a revolt of poor farmers and indentured servants against Indians and Governor's plantations.

**Labor Shortages**

- **Slow Growth Factors:** Unhealthy climate, high death rates, and predominance of male settlers from England and Scotland.

**Indentured Servants**

- **Contractual Labor:** Young British individuals signed contracts to work for landowners for 4-7 years in exchange for passage to the colonies.

**Slavery**

- **Initial Status:** First Africans in Virginia (1619) had similar status to white indentured servants.
- **Legal Changes:** 1660s laws by the House of Burgesses institutionalized slavery, segregating blacks and whites.

**Development of New England**

- **Religious Foundations:** Puritans established colonies but were intolerant, leading to the founding of Rhode Island and Connecticut.

**Rhode Island**

- **Roger Williams:** Founded Providence in 1636, recognizing Native American rights and granting religious freedom.
- **Anne Hutchinson:** Founded Portsmouth, promoting faith alone for salvation.

**Connecticut**

- **Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639):** First written constitution in America, establishing a representative government.

**New Hampshire**

- **Separation from Massachusetts Bay:** Became a royal colony in 1679.

**Halfway Covenant**

- **Religious Membership:** Offered partial church membership without a formal declaration of faith.

**New England Confederation**

- **Colonial Alliance (1643):** Four colonies united for mutual defense, setting a precedent for colonial unity.

**King Philip's War**

- **Native American Conflict:** Led by Metacom, united tribes against settlers, ending in colonial victory and significant Native American resistance.

**The Carolinas**

- **Proprietary Colonies:** Given to eight nobles, developing distinct economies; South Carolina with rice plantations and slavery, North Carolina with small farms and less reliance on slavery.

**New York**

- **Duke of York's Grant:** Charles II granted lands to his brother James, resulting in the takeover of New Amsterdam and establishment of New York.

**New Jersey**

- **Division and Unification:** Originally two proprietary colonies, unified into a single royal colony.

**Pennsylvania and Delaware**

- **Quaker Colonies:** Founded by William Penn for religious refuge, with Delaware separating later.

**Georgia**

- **Last Colony:** Founded with financial support from London.

**Mercantilism and the Empire**

- **Economic Policy:** Colonies served to strengthen England through regulated trade and production. Navigation Acts restricted trade to English ships and goods.
- **Effects:** Benefited New England shipbuilding but imposed high prices and limited colonial manufacturing.

**Slavery**

- **Increased Demand:** Labor shortages and economic needs led to reliance on African slaves. Strict laws ensured control over enslaved populations.
- **Triangular Trade:** England traded goods for slaves in Africa, transported slaves via the Middle Passage, and collected raw materials from the colonies.

**Puritan Influence**

- **Cultural and Intellectual Contributions:** Emphasized a strict moral code and conformity, influencing colonial culture and society.
