What do you think about when you think about America?
What words come to mind? -Justice, Freedom, Equality?
Pictures of Murica play
America is held together by those powerful ideas which people fought and died over
What do they really mean tho?
We stand on the legacy of this fight every day and are challenged to uphold them
14th Amendment cited most
Most people forget about the 14th Amendment despite its importance
**14th Amendment**
Center of promise of America
If you are born in the U.S. you are a citizen and have equal protection which cannot be taken away without due process or court
Says we're all equal on same team
What American Dream is made of
Marriage equality would probably not exist
Promise of society of equals
Definition of citizenship in America
rights are granted and defended
Frederick Douglas
-born into slavery 
-gained freedom
-led revolutions
-broke law and taught himself to read
-got caught but eventually escapes to NYC at 20 years old
-bumps into former enslaved slave who also escaped
-he says don't trust anybody
-watch out for slave catchers
-he is worth a lot of money
-realizes he is not truly free
he claimed every right as a citizen despite that his country didn't
before 14th amendment question of what makes a citizen of the U.S.
citizenship is the right to have rights
all those things we take for granted
Harriet Jacobs
how it feels to be a slave
entirely subject to the will of another
some said only white people could be citizens
founding fathers don't really talk about citizenship
because of that racism flourished
"All men are equal"
3/5th compromise
-excluded natives and 3/5th of other people
-slaves had representation but not rights
first 16th prez were mostly slaveowners
country founded on Declaration of Independence and institution of slavery
enslaved people weren't legally citizens
Some abolitionists had idea that enslaved people were actually citizens
See if they can get public support for this idea
Frances Ellen Watkin Harper
Maria Stewart
Some lectured publicly about it
Harriet Jacobs
told their experiences to provoke Americans into action
Abolitionist movement was diverse
Some branches thought Constitution was evil and wanted destruction of constitution
Other wing with Douglas
Douglas first autobiography was dangerous for him
instantly became a classic
critical to have someone like Douglas who could talk about being a slave
fear of danger to his mind that initialization that some people are born slaves
Why am I a slave?
He felt the horrors of slavery
decided to fight
travels over the world 
devotes life 
probably greatest orator of 19th century
so impressive that southerners spread rumor that he had never been a slave
published the North Star
1852 probably most famous black person in the world
understood what he said was important to anti slavery movement
Constitution is anti-slavery document it said
slavery should not be tolerated
founding fathers had created a document giving every man the right to self governance and human rights
believed that people like him were part of national community
What to the slave if the 4th of July
invited to speak for the 4th of July
his audience was the future
White men and women in audience
Difference between knowing in theory and really understanding
He has to tell them the truth about themselves in 1852
makes them feel comfortable at first
Why am I called upon to speak today?
What do I have to do with this 
You can rejoice
I should mourn
tells them of horrors of slavery 
takes them to horrible heart of what slavery really is
it is hypocritical
speaking to the people on his side, saying they are not doing enough
nation supposed to be built around freedom
as long as slavery exists it is a lie
constitution isn't always crystal clear
why supreme court exists
ultimate authority of judicial system
1857 Dredd Scott vs Sandford
Scott argues he is free because he had lived in free state
Roger B. Taney argues against it
Court says people back then didn't intend black people to be part of the constitution
African-Americans will and never were citizens is what it said
Said they would never be equal
Court said Constitution is completely pro-slavery
Citizenship is the locus of rights 
Lincoln was big critic of that case
partly what he ran on
saw country moving to fight on this topic of slavery
elected in 1860
Civil war starts in 1861
His goal is preserving Union, not freeing slaves
invited small group of African-American leaders to the white house
gave lecture, not discussion
blames presence of black people in America for civil war
wanted them to be separated
says racial equality is not happening, get with the program
wanted to send Black Americans to Central America
Douglas is outraged
Douglas said its slavery that caused the Civil War not the presence of Black people
during the midst of Civil War
government kept saying Blacks couldn't be in militia or army, cause they are savages
why does the government deny black people
Douglass says if blacks go and fight and bleed they can't be denied citizenship
trying to manipulate Lincoln to use black people in war
Finally works
Lincoln signs Emancipation Proclamation - turning point in the war - adds 200,000 men 
black soldiers can join army
they can prove they will fight for freedom
having African Americans serve were powerful against narratives
Began to change white racial attitudes
Douglas says
Mission of war is national regeneration
War would transform U.S. as whole
National Unity
liberty and equality defines civil war
Gettysburg Address - echo of what Douglas has been saying - emancipation is the goal
-a new birth of freedom, what Douglas has been saying
-helping himself grapple with the tragedy
-shows how much a person can change
possibly Douglas and Lincoln came to respect each other
both were self made men
kind of kindred spirits
Douglas is hopeful he can work with Lincoln toward a black American future
Civil War ends
Lincoln gave speech that said African-American soldier that fought should be given suffrage
John Wilkes Booth heard it and said that would be the last speech he would ever make
he was mad over idea of equal citizenship'
Lincoln is killed
8 months after 13th Amendment is ratified and slavery is finally abolished, permanently freeing every enslaved person in American
tragedy includes that presidency passes to Andrew Johnson who is racist and is opposite from Lincoln
when he becomes president he says goal is prevent dilution of citizenship
when Douglas visits he thinks Douglas is beneath him
says Douglas is a n word
Johnson doesn't support rights of former slaves
Just because you're free doesn't mean you are a citizen
South states pass Black Codes
basically slavery 
but southern legislature says its not slavery
if black person tries to exercises freedom they could be jailed and forced into labor
John Bingham - Ohio congressman
says they have to amend the Constitution
led way to heart of 14th Amendment
Wanted America to live up to its promise
fight to make 14 a constitutional amendment
Amendments are hard to pass but hard to get rid of
they need 28 states to agree
1868 14th Amendment becomes part of Constitution
proves U.S. is on board for mission of equality for all
All people born and naturalized in the U.S. are citizens
No state shall make or abridge any laws that take away rights
all citizens have right to bill of rights
gave them right to go to court
gave equal protection of law
overturns Dred Scott decision
moves us from white male nation to future with possibility within democracy
first time equal is used in constitution
modern constitution
cause of tremendous celebration
One of biggest success is growth of educational institutions
Frederick Douglas had aptitude that could not be contained
statue of Roger B. Taney removed
descendants of Taney apologize to Scotts
