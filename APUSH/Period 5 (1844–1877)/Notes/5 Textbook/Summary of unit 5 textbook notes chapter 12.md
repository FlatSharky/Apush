### ***Territorial and Economic Expansion***

#### **Manifest Destiny**

- Coined by John O'Sullivan, Manifest Destiny was the belief that the U.S. had a divine mission to extend its power and civilization across North America.
- Initially focused on western expansion to the Pacific, Mexico, and Central America; by the 1890s, it included ambitions for Pacific and Caribbean islands.
- The 1840s saw a surge in expansionist fervor driven by nationalism, population growth, economic development, technological advancements, and reform ideals.
- Not all Americans supported expansion; many Northerners saw it as a means to spread slavery.

#### **Conflicts over Texas, Maine, and Oregon**

- Texas: Originally a Mexican province, tensions rose as American settlers outnumbered Mexicans. Mexico's laws banning slavery and requiring Catholic conversion were ignored by Americans. Texas declared independence after conflicts, notably the Alamo and the Battle of San Jacinto.*
- Maine: The boundary dispute with British-controlled Canada led to the Aroostook War, resolved by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.*
- Oregon: Both Britain and the U.S. claimed the territory. American settlers in the 1840s fueled the push for U.S. control, leading to the slogan "Fifty-four Forty or Fight."*

#### **Election of 1844**

- James K. Polk, a Democrat, won the presidency with promises of annexing Texas, reoccupying Oregon, and acquiring California. The election signaled support for expansion.

#### **Annexing Texas and Dividing Oregon**

- Texas was annexed in 1845 under President Tyler. The Oregon territory was divided along the 49th parallel to avoid conflict with Britain, while the U.S. prepared for war with Mexico.

#### **War with Mexico**

- The U.S.-Mexico War (1846-1848) stemmed from disputes over Texas' southern border and U.S. desires for California and New Mexico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war, establishing the Rio Grande as the Texas border and ceding California and New Mexico to the U.S.

#### **Further Expansion and Conflicts**

- Southern expansionists eyed territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. Efforts to acquire Cuba and Central American regions like Nicaragua mostly failed.
- The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with Britain ensured neither nation would control a Central American canal.
- The Gadsden Purchase (1853) secured land for a southern transcontinental railroad.

#### **Post-Civil War Expansion**

- Focus shifted to internal migration and settlement.
- The Mining Frontier saw significant migrations due to gold and silver discoveries.
- The Farming Frontier was supported by laws like the Preemption Acts, promoting settlement and land purchase.
- Western cities grew due to railroads, mineral wealth, and agriculture.

#### **Economic Growth and Innovation**

- Industrial technology spread beyond New England post-1840.
- Railroads became crucial for transport and economic development.
- Foreign commerce grew with innovations in shipping and new trade routes, including opening Japan to American trade.

#### **Manifest Destiny and Its Legacy**

- Expansion had significant racial motives, impacting Native Americans and Mexican territories.
- Modern historians focus on the contributions of various ethnic groups and the roles of women in the West.
- Debates continue over whether U.S. actions were driven by imperialism or racism.
