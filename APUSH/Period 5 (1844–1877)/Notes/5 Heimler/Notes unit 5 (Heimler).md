-religious refuge - Mormons
Preemption Acts - lots of land for cheap
-middle class mostly went west for land
James K. Polk - 1844
-believer in manifest destiny
-wanted Texas and Oregon
Texas - 1830 - 3x as many Americans then Mexicans in Texas - southern, Protestant, slave-owning
-1829 Mexican government told immigrants in Texas to
-convert to Roman Catholicism

**Mexican - American War**
causes 
-annexation of Texas by U.S. by James K. Polk predecessor John Tyler
-John Slidell sent to Mexico city to sell them New Mexico and California territories
-border- Mexicans : Nueces River - American : Rio Grande
-Polk stationed troops at Rio Grande - sent Zachary Taylor - 11 Americans dead - Polk wanted war

-small amount of American military got enough ground to get California and New Mexico land
-Winfield Scoot captured and occupied Mexico City - forced Mexico to negotiate

effects
-land for America - Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 1848 - Rio Grande as Southern Border, Mexican Cession - Mexico ceded California and New Mexico to U.S. for 15 million dollars
-all that plus Gadsden Purchase = Mexico lost more than half its territory to U.S.
-David Wilmot - Wilmot Proviso - Any land gained from winning Mexican-American war is off limits to expansion of slavery - voted down but shows growing tension over slavery
-free soil - additional land for homesteaders to settle without competition from slavery - more economic than moral
-some historians point to Proviso as first round that leads to Civil War
-non Americans in those lands just stayed there, Mexicans and Indians
-Guadalupe-Hidalgo said Mexicans in those territories would be made U.S. citizens, but not Natives
-both groups faced assault on civil rights - voter discrimination, educational segregation
**Growing tension caused by slavery from 1844-Civil War + proposals**
Southern position
-slavery was constitutional right
-Missouri compromise already decided where slavery could exist - was important to Southerners
-they saw any attempt to slow slavery as threat to its entirety 
Free soil movement
-Northern Democrats and Whigs
-Wanted new territories acquired to be dominion of free laborers
-wasn't cause moral but economic
-they wanted black people just gone
 -abolitionists wanted slavery gone everywhere - some went on to create Free Soil party
 Popular Sovereignty
-people power
-each territory should decide slavery for itself
-paper worked, reality increased tensions
Mexican American war = more land = more tensions
-Southerners threatened secession because Cali and New Mexico entered as free states
-because balance was threatened
-Compromise of 1850 - Henry Clay
- Mexican Cession divided into Utah and New Mexico and would do popular sovereignty
- California as free state
- Slave trade banned in D.C.
- Stricter fugitive slave law
-fugitive slave law broke the calm
-North was against slavery, and so them enforcing law would be difficult
**Regional attitudes toward slavery**
-beef about 
- slavery and expansion
- immigration
Immigrants
-large number of immigrants before civil war, mostly German and Irish
-settled in cultural enclaves
-together in ethnic communities where they kept culture alive
-many Irish settled in NYC

-Know-Nothing Party
-Nativism movement tried to limit immigrants political and cultural influence
Slavery
-labor systems
- North -  free wage laborers manufacturing in factories - growing population
- South - enslaved labor on agricultural plantations
-Free soil movement - if new slave states entered it would make it harder for free wage laborers to get jobs
-didn't want slavery gone from South, just new territories
-Southerners saw it as threat
-Abolitionists - minority in North, made up what they lacked in number with volume
-effective strategies and tactics - words, helped fugitives escape, violence

- William Lloyd Garrison - Liberator
- Harriet Beecher Stowe - Uncle Tom's Cabin 1852 - sold like crazy 
	 - Northerners saw slavery clearly
	 - Southerners banned it
-spoken
- Frederick Douglass

	-  Underground Railroad - series of trails and safe houses to escape slavery - used by tens of thousands - some went to Canada cause stricter slave law
- John Brown - only way to rid slavery was through slave uprising in South - planned to raid federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry 1859 to steal weapons, distribute and ignite rebellion
	- captured arsenal but repulsed by other battalion led by Robert E. Lee
	- plan fell to pieces and he was hanged
	- he was connected to other abolitionists and South saw this as what abolitionists were really about
	- thought what they really wanted was race war
**Failure of compromises**
-tensions caused by expansion west
Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854
-was above 36 30 line but in 1854 senator of Illinois Stephen Douglas proposed that it territory be divided into two. Kansas and Nebraska territories + proposed they do popular sovereignty
-Congress basically overturned compromise of 1820 by passing this law which Northerners held onto
-Kansas had fight between pro-slavery and anti-slavery to gain control
-Known as bleeding Kansas
-1500 men, but almost 6000 votes
-Missouri which was slave state had people go over to cast illegal pro-slavery votes
-Solution : two legislatures in Kansas
- pro-slavery - constitution in Lecompton
- anti-slavery - refused to acknowledge, wrote own document and set up in Topeka
- President Franklin Pierce said pro-slavery was legit while anti-slavery was fraudulent
Dred Scott decision
-Dred Scott - enslaved man in Missouri, moved by owner to Illinois and Wisconsin where slavery was illegal
-Dred Scott sued for freedom as he lived in free territory for 2 years
-Southern Democrat Chief Justice Roger Taney + majority of court decided against it
- as a slave, and not a citizen he couldn't sue in federal court
- Constitution states that Congress couldn't deprive citizen of property meaning any territory or state is effectively open to slavery
-increasing division over slavery weakened two party system
- Whigs became Cotton Whigs(pro-slavery) and Conscience Whigs(anti-slavery) cause of Kansas-Nebraska Act
- Democratic Party gained strength as regional, proslavery party
- New party - Republican Party in 1854 under diverse group of people -advocated against spread of slavery not its removal - Southern Democrats saw it as threat to slavery everywhere
	- Former Know Nothing members
	- Abolitionists
	- Free Soilers
	- Conscience Whigs
1858 Republicans did good which scared Southerners
**Election of 1860 - precipitated secession + civil war**
Effects of election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860
Republican Party did good in midterm elections
Democrats - Stephen Douglas
Republican - Abraham Lincoln - Free Soil platform - didn't want to abolish slavery
-Democrats divided between North and South, was not unified
- Northern Democrats - Stephen Douglas, popular sovereignty
- Southern Democrats - John Breckinridge, slavery in new territories protected by federal slave code, then popular sovereignty
-Lincoln won 40% but carried electoral vote - won without single vote from Southern states
-Southerners saw it as even if they used all their political power they couldn't win and were threatened
-They thought how much longer can we survive in the Union
-December of 1860 before Lincoln's inauguration South Carolina seceded - within six weeks six more states - Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana - later Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina
-Became Confederate States of America
-created constitution that was similar but limited federal power and put slavery as not able to be abolished
-why did they secede?
- slavery or
- states rights
-states had articles of secession explaining why they left
Texas - Lincoln election = country controlled by great sectional party, charged Republicans with nefarious agenda of abolition of negro slavery and political equality of whites and negros
Mississippi - thoroughly allied with slavery
-first president Jefferson Davis said nothing about slavery in inauguration speech
-Vice president Alexander Stephens - foundation of Confederacy is in white men over black, which is by slavery
**Civil War**
Factors that contributed to Union victory
-wasn't obvious from start
South
-Defensive war
-Experienced military leaders(Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson)
North
-4x population of South
-robust navy for seas and rivers
-economic advantage - banks, manufacturing, railroads
-well-established federal government
both had to use whole economies
-North kicked up manufacturing
-South relied on tariffs and taxes on exports for war revenue - but union had naval blockade - financial mess
-Confederacy tried to war tax, but many people and states simply refused
-North had NYC draft riots in 1836 - people could avoid draft by paying 300 dollars, working class saw it as fundamental injustice - at least 120 people killed
-Fort Sumter - federal possession in South Carolina - Lincoln sent provisions to trapped fort - South blew up Union suppliers - first official salvo of war
-South won initially
-First Battle of Bull Run - 30,000 Union troops vs Confederate at Bull Run Creek in Virginia - civilians watched with picnics
-Union was winning, but after Confederate backup with Stonewall Jackson Confederate won
-disillusioned both sides of short and tidy war
Strategies
-Anaconda Plan(Union) - naval advantage to blockade ports on Mississippi River, cut Confederacy in half
-Southern Plan - relied on foreign help - Britain and France cause cotton, but they didn't cause India and Egypt could produce cotton.
Union leadership
-Ulysses S. Grant
Emancipation Proclamation of 1862
-freed all enslaved people in states in active rebellion against Union starting January 1st
-more of military society than announcement of freedom
-changed war to saving Union to getting rid of slavery in U.S.
-good strategy cause
- enslaved Confederacy workers escaped and ran to Union lines - some even fought
- Closed door on British help, who had just abolished slavery
Key victories
-Battle of Vicksburg - gained control of Mississippi river
Damage to Confederate infrastructure
William Tecumseh Sherman - to capture Atlanta but basically burnt it to the ground
-March to the Sea - Atlanta to Savannah, scorched earth policy
Appomattox Courthouse - Lee formally surrendered to Grant
**How Union government acted during war**
How did Lincoln's leadership during Civil War impact American ideals over course of war
Emancipation Proclamation  - good strategy
-cut of hope of European diplomatic support for South
-made occasion for many Southern slaves to escape
Gettysburg Address of 1836
-Unify the nation
-struggle against slavery as fulfillment of America's founding democratic ideals
-Lincoln wasn't even main act, it was Edward Everett
-Short speech but it was GOAT status
 **Reconstruction**
 effects of government policy during Reconstruction on society from 1865 to 1877
 Should Confederacy be treated leniently or as conquered foe
 -Lincoln - lenient - South never actually left Union as it was legally impossible - treating Southerners bad would only reignite issue
 -Ten-Percent plan - minimum test of political loyalty for southern states to return to Union
 - reestablish state government if 10% of 1860 electorate pledged loyalty to Union
 - State legislature had to ratify 13th Amendment which abolished slavery
 -put barrier for reentry very low
 -Lincoln was killed few weeks before official end of war by John Wilkes Booth
 -Vice President Andrew Johnson became President -  tried to carry out Lincoln's plan but did not support emancipation - stood by as former slave owners gained power again
 -Black codes - restricted freedom of southern black folks
 -Radical Republicans - didn't appreciate Johnson's leniency or complicity in resegregating the South 
 - they wanted the South to pay
 - Wanted reconstruction by Congress not president
 - wanted to pass legislation for rights of black people while suppressing Southern resurgence
 -passed
 - Freedmen's Bureau - agency help newly freed black people get on their feet
 - Civil Rights Act of 1866 - protected black folks citizenship and equal protection under laws
 -Andrew Johnson vetoed both
 -Radical Republicans in Congress got mad and overrode veto with two-thirds majority 
 -Republicans feared overturning of Civil Rights Act and proposed constitutional amendment
 -14th Amendment - all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. were citizens of U.S. and every citizen enjoyed equal protection of laws on state level
 -final contest was Reconstruction Acts of 1867 - passed over Johnson's veto
 -ultimately meant failure of Reconstruction
 -enforced all laws being passed in South
 -Republicans divided South into 5 districts under federal military occupation
-increased requirements for states to join back to Union
- have to ratify 14th Amendment + add in state's constitution provision for universal male voting rights

-impeachment - means trial whether President should be removed
-Tenure of Office Act - illegal for prez to fire cabinet member without approval from congress
-Johnson fired cabinet member as result
-held trial but didn't oust him by 1 vote
-still basically rendered him powerless for further Reconstruction
-15th Amendment - voting rights for new free blacks in South
-Women's rights advocates like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony got mad
-split women's rights into two groups
-National Woman Suffrage Association - fight for suffrage 
-American Woman Suffrage Association - others said Reconstruction efforts federally while women's suffrage on state level
**How Reconstruction failed**
How Southern society and economics didn't change much after war
How and why Reconstruction officially ended
-newly freed blacks in south established schools, colleges, got elected to solidify independence + Freedman Bureau
-White population in South created societal conditions basically the same as slavery and segregation
-South was still agricultural powerhouse and solution for no slavery was  black workers would work in field but had to sign contract that bound them to plantation and gave owners right to extract unlimited slavery
-sharecropping - land owners provided seed and farm supplies to worker in exchange for share of harvest
-good on paper, but basically became slavery
White Supremacy
-Southerners didn't recognize black people as equal
-formation of KKK in 1867
-formed on principle that whites were superior to blacks
-they burned buildings, controlled local politics through intimidation, and public and private lynching's of black people
-Black Codes - Southern legislations placed
EX.
- Blacks couldn't borrow money to buy or rent land leading to them having to turn to sharecropping
- black people couldn't testify against whites in court
- racial segregation of southern society
-all happened under federal occupation
-Reconstruction ended in 1877 because prez election between Samuel Tilden and Rutherford B. Hayes + northerners focused on industrial development than race problem
-Tilden won majority popular vote but neither got enough electoral votes
-South Carolina, Louisiana, Florida had Democrats and Republicans claimed victory
-special electoral commission was formed - republican majority and elected Hayes the Republican
-Democrats threatened to block Haye's inauguration
-Compromise of 1877 - Democrats conceded election to Hayes, but all federal troops removed from South
-End of Reconstruction
