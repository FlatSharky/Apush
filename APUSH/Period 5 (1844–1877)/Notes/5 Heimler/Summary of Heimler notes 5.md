### Westward Expansion

- **Manifest Destiny**: Coined by John O'Sullivan in July 1845, it was the belief that Americans were destined by God to expand across the continent from sea to sea.
- **Motivations for Moving West**:
    - **Economic Opportunities**: Pursuit of mineral and natural resources, such as the California Gold Rush in 1848.
    - **Homesteading**: Middle-class families sought land via Preemption Acts, which offered cheap land.
    - **Religious Refuge**: Groups like the Mormons moved west to escape religious persecution.
- **James K. Polk and Expansion**:
    - **Election of 1844**: Polk, a strong proponent of Manifest Destiny, sought to acquire Texas and Oregon.
    - **Texas**: In the 1830s, more Americans than Mexicans settled in Texas, bringing their Southern, Protestant, and slave-owning culture. Despite Mexican laws to convert settlers to Catholicism and outlaw slavery, Americans ignored these rules.
    - **Texas Independence**: Following tensions and conflicts, Texans revolted in 1836, leading to the Battle of San Jacinto where Mexican General Santa Anna was captured and forced to recognize Texas' independence. However, Mexico did not formally recognize this independence, and Texas' statehood was delayed.
    - **Oregon Territory**: Disputed between the U.S. and Britain, it was divided at the 49th parallel during Polk's presidency.

### Mexican-American War

- **Causes**:
    - **Annexation of Texas**: By the U.S., initially under John Tyler, exacerbated tensions.
    - **Territorial Ambitions**: Polk sent John Slidell to Mexico to negotiate the purchase of New Mexico and California, but it failed.
    - **Border Dispute**: Conflict over whether the Texas border was the Nueces River (Mexican claim) or the Rio Grande (U.S. claim).
    - **Military Action**: Polk stationed troops at the Rio Grande, leading to a skirmish and subsequent war declaration after American casualties.
- **Outcomes**:
    - **Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)**: Ended the war, establishing the Rio Grande as the border and ceding California and New Mexico to the U.S. for $15 million.
    - **Wilmot Proviso**: Proposed to ban slavery in the newly acquired territories, highlighting growing sectional tensions.
    - **Gadsden Purchase**: Further land acquisition from Mexico solidified U.S. expansion.

### Growing Tension Over Slavery (1844-Civil War)

- **Southern Position**:
    - Slavery as a constitutional right and essential to their way of life.
    - Any threat to slavery seen as a threat to the entire institution.
- **Free Soil Movement**:
    - Comprised of Northern Democrats and Whigs who wanted new territories to be free of slavery, mainly for economic reasons.
    - Opposed slavery expansion but not necessarily on moral grounds.
- **Popular Sovereignty**:
    - Idea that residents of a territory should decide the slavery issue themselves, leading to practical tensions and conflict.
- **Compromise of 1850**:
    - Admitted California as a free state, introduced stricter fugitive slave laws, and allowed popular sovereignty in Utah and New Mexico.
- **Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**:
    - Allowed these territories to decide on slavery via popular sovereignty, nullifying the Missouri Compromise and leading to "Bleeding Kansas."
- **Dred Scott Decision**:
    - Supreme Court ruling that declared African Americans were not citizens and that Congress could not ban slavery in the territories.

### Regional Attitudes Toward Slavery and Immigration

- **Immigrants**:
    - Large influx of German and Irish immigrants, often settling in urban enclaves.
    - Faced anti-Catholic sentiment and nativism, leading to the rise of the Know-Nothing Party.
- **Labor Systems**:
    - **North**: Free wage laborers in factories.
    - **South**: Enslaved labor on agricultural plantations.
- **Abolitionists**:
    - Prominent figures like William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe highlighted the moral evils of slavery.
    - Activists used various methods, including the Underground Railroad and direct action, to oppose slavery.
- **John Brown's Raid**:
    - Attempted to incite a slave rebellion by raiding the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry in 1859.

### Failure of Compromises

- **Kansas-Nebraska Act**:
    - Led to violent clashes in Kansas between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers.
- **Dred Scott Decision**:
    - Deepened the national divide over slavery.
- **Formation of the Republican Party**:
    - Emerged in 1854, opposing the spread of slavery into new territories.
- **Election of 1860**:
    - Abraham Lincoln's victory without Southern support led to Southern secession and the formation of the Confederacy.

### Civil War and Reconstruction

- **Union vs. Confederacy**:
    - Union had advantages in population, industrial capacity, and a strong federal government.
    - Confederacy had experienced military leaders and fought a defensive war.
